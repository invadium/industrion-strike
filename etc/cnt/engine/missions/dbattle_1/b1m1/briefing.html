<p><b>Magdalena Crossway System.<br> Mission #1: First skirmish.</b></p>

<p>Our reconnaissance group has passed through the space-time anomaly point
to Magdalena crossway system. Deep radar scanning shows unusual
traffic in this area. There are some military units amongst the trade convoys.
And this is not a usual militia escort.</p>

<p>There are several small bogies in 50 klicks from our initial point.
Probably pirates, but we must know certainly. Your mission objective is
to find out their intention.</p>

<p>One Hornet-class fighter is under your control.
Fly to Navigation Point A and back.
If objects will be hostile engage them.
We need no foe ships near the point of our fleet deployment. </p>

<p>Usually pirates do not engage regular navy and prefer retreat.
Generally their ships are poorly equipped.
However, we will be tracing them on our scanners 
and will inform you if they will decide to engage you.</p>
