<p><b>Magdalena Crossway System.<br> Mission #4: Stop the convoy.</b></p>
<p>Despite we have declared all anomaly points lead to N-9412 as blockade zone, big convoy approaching us.
It seems like Industion government ignored all our warnings and decided to send help to rebellion.</p>
<p>Industion group consists of two transport ships and one corvette. Also group has fighter escort.
Transport ships loaded by supplies that rebels can't produce themselves.
And those supplies will allow rebels to survive at least several weeks in blockade condition. <p>
<p>We have to stop that convoy at any cost.</p>
