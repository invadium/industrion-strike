<p><b>Magdalena Crossway System.<br> Mission #2: Pirates' answer.</b></p>

<p>We have found Magdalena Crossway System ready for deployment of our operative group. There is no any significant force here to prevent our unwrapping.</p>
<p>It has been planned that corvette <Hercules> will pass trough the space-time anomaly point 16 hours since our reconnaissance group has passed. She will takes data package with telemetry and scanning. Then she'll return to Tor System and will deliver the package to General Mahes, vice-commander of Dominion's operative group. Meanwhile, our reconnaissance group will hold the position near space-time anomaly point.</p>
<p>You will provide the security of both corvettes ("Superb" and "Hercules") during the transmission process and while "Hercules" will be calculating and processing travel through the space-time anomaly point to Tor System.</p>
