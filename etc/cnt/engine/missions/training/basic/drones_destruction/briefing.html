<p><b>Basic Training: Intersept Drones</b></p>

<p>
It's time to learn flight controls and missile controls.
</p>
<p>
Destroy 3 enemy drones before they reach their destination - <b>Beacon D</b>.
</p>
<p>
You have 2 Stinger missiles loaded. Select target with <b>Space</b> key
or by clicking on the radar mark. Use <b>V</b> key to launch a missile.
You could also launch a missile with camera mounted to it,
so you could observe how it will hit the target. Use <b>B</b> key for that.
Note, that it takes some time to reload the missile.
The time remaining displayed on the <b>RCH</b> indicator.
</p>
<p>
Tactics here is following. You select first drone and kill it by a missile.
Then accelerate with <b>A</b> key and finish second drone by lasers.
By that time missile launcher should be recharged - target final drone
and kill it by a missile.
