<p><b>Basic Training: Destroy Probes</b></p>

<p>
First you have to learn orientation controls and laser gun controls.
Also, during this mission you'll become familiar with radar readings.
</p>
<p>
You will be occupying laser turret.
Destroy enemy probes comming out from the anomaly point.
</p>
<p>
Use arrow keys for orientation in space.
Use <b>C</b> key to fire lasers.
Use <b>Spacebar</b> key to select closest target to your crosshair.
Usually green crosshair turns yellow and then red when you
are aiming your target regarding it's speed.
</p>
<p>
Look at the radar readings to determine dirrection and distance to your target.
Enemy targets are displayed in red, your targets are displayed in green
and neutral targets are displayed in white.
Use <b>+/-</b> keys or mouse wheel when mouse over the radar
to zoom in/out. The radar could be set to display range from 2000m to 100000m.
