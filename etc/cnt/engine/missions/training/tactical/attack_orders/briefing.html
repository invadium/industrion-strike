<p><b>Tactical Training: Attack Orders</b></p>

<p>
There are 3 enemy drones in the area trying to reach Bouys A and B.
You have orders to stop them with 2 Mirage fighters under your control.
Manual control over the fighters is disabled.
Use tactical control to set targets and aggression level.
</p>
<p>
First, zoom the radar to the level you could determine tactical situation around.
Navigation buoys are shown on the radar as white dots.
Your fighters are green dots and enemy drones are red dots.
</p>
<p>
Use <b>W</b> and <b>E</b> keys to jump from one fighter to another.
Use <b>Q</b> key to switch into free camera mode.
This mode provides you with more flexible way of orientation.
When in free camera mode, target one of your fighters and hit <b>Space</b>
to jump inside it. Or just click on it's mark on the radar.
</p>
<p>
Task control of the ship available when you are inside (not in free camera mode).
Task screen is displayed in the right bottom.
It shows primary and secondary tasks, current orders (None, Attack or Follow)
and the agression level settings.
</p>
<p>
The central area shows current targeting settings - the ship you are targeting,
it's speed(SPD), shield(SHL) and hull(HUL) status and it's current orders
(A means Attack, F means Follow).
Below, target name and distance to it is displayed.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to set primary and secondary task for current ship is
to double click on radar marks.
Left double click sets primary task and right double click sets secondary task.
</p>
<p>
Another option is to use your keyboard.
Use <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> keys to list available targets in the area.
Once target is set, you could set it as primary (<b>;</b>) or as secondary
(<b>'</b>) task.
Keys <b>1-4</b> set the aggression level.
In this mission default aggression setting is 1.
I recomend to set it to 3 or 4, so your fighters will use both lasers and missiles
when attacking.
</p>
<p>
Good hunting!
